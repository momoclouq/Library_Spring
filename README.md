# Library_Spring
A basic backend for managing a library app using Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL

## How to use
- Clone the repo, install postgres on your machine
- Change the information of your postgres in the AppConfig.java file (the old data is for my personal testing)
- Run the app using the Terminal and use Postman to test the functionalities
